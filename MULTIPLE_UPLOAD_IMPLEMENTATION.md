# Multiple File Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview
Modified the file upload functionality to allow users to upload multiple files at once while maintaining the pipeline type selection dropdown. This change streamlines the upload process and improves user experience.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`backend/src/routes/upload.js`)

1. **Modified `handleUpload` function:**
   - Changed from handling single file (`req.file`) to multiple files (`req.files || [req.file]`)
   - Added support for storing multiple file information
   - Updated response to include file count and file details
   - Maintained backward compatibility with single file uploads

2. **Updated upload endpoints:**
   - Changed from `multer.single('fastq')` to `multer.array('files')`
   - All three pipeline endpoints (illumina, iontorrent, its) now support multiple files
   - Maintained the legacy endpoint for backward compatibility

### Frontend Changes (`src/html/upload.html`)

1. **Updated upload forms:**
   - Replaced separate file inputs with single multi-file input
   - Added `multiple` attribute to file inputs
   - Expanded accepted file types to include `.fa` files
   - Added helpful description text for each pipeline type

2. **Enhanced JavaScript functionality:**
   - Modified `handleUpload` function to handle multiple files
   - Added `displaySelectedFiles` function to show selected files with sizes
   - Added `formatFileSize` helper function for readable file sizes
   - Updated progress and status messages to reflect multiple file uploads

3. **Improved user interface:**
   - Added selected files display with file names and sizes
   - Enhanced status messages to show file count
   - Added form reset functionality that clears selected files list

### CSS Changes (`src/static/css/upload.css`)

1. **Added styles for new UI elements:**
   - Styling for selected files list
   - Enhanced form text styling
   - Improved visual feedback for file selection

## Features

### Multiple File Support
- Users can select multiple files at once using Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click
- File list displays with names and sizes
- Progress tracking for entire upload batch
- Success messages show total files uploaded

### Pipeline Type Selection
- Maintained dropdown for selecting analysis type:
  - Illumina - for FASTQ files
  - IonTorrent - for BARCODES + FASTQ files  
  - ITS - for FASTQ files
- Each pipeline type shows appropriate file format guidance

### Enhanced User Experience
- Real-time file selection preview
- Progress bar for upload tracking
- Clear status messages and error handling
- Responsive design maintained

## File Types Supported
- `.fastq` - FASTQ sequence files
- `.fq` - FASTQ sequence files (alternative extension)
- `.fastq.gz` - Compressed FASTQ files
- `.fa` - FASTA sequence files

## API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "runId": "uuid-string",
  "jobId": "job-id",
  "pipelineType": "illumina|iontorrent|its",
  "uploadPath": "uploads/uuid-string",
  "filesUploaded": 3,
  "files": [
    {
      "name": "sample1.fastq",
      "path": "/uploads/uuid/sample1.fastq", 
      "size": 1024000
    }
  ],
  "message": "3 file(s) uploaded and illumina pipeline job queued successfully"
}
```

## Backward Compatibility
- Legacy single file upload endpoint (`/api/upload/file`) still works
- Existing pipeline processing code unchanged
- Database schema unchanged - uses first file as primary input path

## Testing
Created `test-multiple-upload.html` for testing the new functionality without the full application context.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select Pipeline Type:** Choose the appropriate analysis type from the dropdown
2. **Select Files:** Click the file input and select multiple files (use Ctrl+Click for multiple selection)
3. **Review Selection:** Check the selected files list to confirm correct files are chosen
4. **Upload:** Click the upload button to start the batch upload
5. **Monitor Progress:** Watch the progress bar and status messages
6. **Completion:** Receive confirmation with upload ID and file count

This implementation maintains all existing functionality while significantly improving the user experience for file uploads.
